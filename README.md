# Tictactrip / Trainline search bar

### Development

Technologies used : React.js + Sass + react-calendar + Cypress.
All commentaries done with jsDoc.
The main searchbar is based on TrainLine search bar but the overall design has been made to fit Tictactrip graphic universe :)
The homepage and the search bar are responsive and can be viewed on both mobile and desktop formats.

### Things that could be improved :)

Passenger section needs to be finalized, with the selection of train cards linked to each passenger to calculate the price.
